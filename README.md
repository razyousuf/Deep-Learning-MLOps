# âœ… Deep-Learning-MLOps

## ðŸ”¢ Steps

1. Data Ingestion â€¯ # Download, extract, and prepare raw data
2. Create the base model â€¯ # Download the VGG16 with Conv. layers only, add the customized dense layers to it, and save both models
3. Train and the base model â€¯ # Train the model on processed data
4. Evaluate the base model with MLflow â€¯# Log metrics, params, and model using MLflow
5. Create the prediction pipeline â€¯ # Build serving logic for inference (e.g., API/UI integration)

## Workflow for each step

1. Update the config.yaml. # changeble vars and urls
2. Update the params.yaml & read it. # Specify hyperparameters and tunable settings
3. Update the entity & read it. # Create dataclasses to structure config _return-type_ of functions
4. Update the configuration manager in src config. # Parse YAMLs, instantiate entity configs
5. Update the components. # Write the logic for this step (e.g., download, train, evaluate)
6. Update the pipeline. # Sequence component calls using the pipeline class
7. Update the main.py. # Create entry/end point to trigger the pipeline with logging
8. Update the dvc.yaml. # Track dependencies, outputs, and automate pipeline with DVC
